## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bernadinebarrtlette2/fraud-detection-project.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Open the main analysis notebook
jupyter notebook fraud_detection_analysis.ipynb
```
## Analysis Workflow
The main notebook covers the complete fraud detection pipeline:
1. **Data Generation** - Create a realistic transaction dataset with fraud patterns
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** - Discover fraud patterns and business insights
3. **Feature Engineering** - Create 21 sophisticated features for ML models
4. **Model Building** - Train and evaluate multiple fraud detection algorithms
5. **Business Analysis** - Calculate ROI, cost savings, and implementation strategy
6. **Results & Recommendations** - Executive summary and next steps

## Model Performance
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | Business Impact |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Random Forest** | **99.8%** | **87.6%** | **78.3%** | **Selected Model** |
| Logistic Regression | 99.2% | 27.4% | 97.0% | Too many false positives |
| Isolation Forest | 40.0% | 39.7% | 40.4% | Poor performance |

## Key Features Engineered
- **Time-based patterns**: Hour, day, weekend indicators with cyclical encoding
- **Amount analysis**: Transaction size vs customer income ratios
